## Description
A small collection of easy code challenges, wrapped up in a test-driven format. I first made this repo in ~ 2015, and refactored it in 2021.

## Motivation

I wanted to document my progress as I work through these challenges in one place. Years later, it is interesting to look back and see what progress I've made. I am also using this as a way to get more fluent with unit testing and TDD.
