## Synopsis

I am collecting my answers to code challenges in Python here. Mostly Python 3, some Python 2. These are taken from sources like CoderByte and HackerRank.

## Code Example

All of the files are separate bits of code, usually wrapped inside a function. The functions will return the answer to the challenge question.

## Motivation

I wanted to document my progress as I work through these challenges in one place. It is also good to keep solutions handy in case I need to use one of these functions in a bigger program.

## 2021 update! 
After many years, I am updating this with slightly better code, and test-driven dev structure!
